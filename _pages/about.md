title: About the Project
---
Grounded AI, is a giant visualization of what AI and algorithms are doing in science, based on 2 million scientific papers retrieved from Scopus. In popular media, AI is often simplified as “good” or “bad,” moving between “hype” and “fear.” In scientific fields, however, algorithmic developments are less sensational, often addressing issues that go unnoticed by the public. Rather than simplifying AI, this project invites public engagement to reflect on algorithms’ broader impact.

We are co-creating an interactive exhibition with data physicalization, user journeys, and chatbots as guides. Our goal is to make complex scientific networks relatable, providing a space for exploration and reflection without increasing barriers between science and the public.

## Current status

We are in the process of printing the Grounded AI Map. Upcoming: workshop with the Danish Technical Museum for a 2025 exhibition.

More to do.
