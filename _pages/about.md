title: About the Project
---

This map is the result of a research project that aims to ground AI. Literally: It puts the entire scientific literature on algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence on the floor for you to walk on and explore.

We talk a lot about AI, especially the spectacular, sensationalist and revolutionizing aspects of AI, but maybe we tend to forget the mundane ways in which it is already everywhere around us. From speech recognition to flight control or cybersecurity, from analyses of everything from tea quality and swim technique to hormone secretion and mammograms for diagnosing breast cancer, AI and machine learning algorithms already feature as a solution to a range of existing problems.

Sometimes, these applications cause harm or pose risks in ways that raise public concern. More often than not, they never become part of public discourse. Should they? We invite you to explore the multifaceted landscape of artificial intelligence and its associated algorithms, technologies and applications to help us figure out the answer.
